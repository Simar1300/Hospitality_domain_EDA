# Hospitality Domain Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a hospitality dataset, which includes booking information across different hotels, booking platforms, room categories, and guest feedback. The EDA uncovers key insights related to booking trends, revenue generation, occupancy rates, customer ratings, and more. This analysis helps in understanding patterns and behaviors within the hospitality sector, such as the occupancy differences between weekdays and weekends, city-wise performance, and the impact of room categories on revenue.

## What the Project Does

This project performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Identifies and handles missing values, checks for outliers, and ensures data consistency.
2. **Data Analysis:** Evaluates key metrics such as occupancy rates, booking trends, and revenue analysis across multiple dimensions like cities, room categories, and time periods.
3. **Visualizations:** Provides insightful visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, to illustrate the relationships between variables, including occupancy rates, revenue generation, and customer ratings.
4. **Business Insights:** Derives actionable insights for hotel management, such as identifying peak revenue periods, the most popular booking platforms, and city-specific performance analysis.

## Why the Project is Useful

This project is useful for:
- **Hotel Managers:** To understand which room categories or cities are performing well and when occupancy rates are higher (weekdays vs. weekends).
- **Marketing and Revenue Teams:** To identify which booking platforms generate the most revenue and to evaluate customer satisfaction through ratings analysis.
- **Data Analysts:** As a reference for conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospitality-related data, providing insight into cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis techniques.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hospitality-eda.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install the required Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in sequence to see the analysis and visualizations:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook hospitality_eda.ipynb
     ```

4. **Access the Data:**
   - The data files used in this analysis should be located in the `/data` folder. You can use your own data by replacing these files.

## Project Structure

- **`hospitality_eda.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the raw data files used for the analysis.
- **`visualizations/`**: Contains the visual outputs (charts and plots) generated during the analysis.
